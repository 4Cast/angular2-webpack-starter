find our contract variation order for the additional works required to the FESA access road. Additional works include the following:\r\r1) Install Trafficable pits: Further to our RFI C044 regarding the services pits located along the FESA Access road; we were instructed on 18/02/2013 to supply and install Class D trafficable pits as required. 2 No. Class D pits were required along the road. Drawing C0.01 calls for existing pit lids to be adjusted to suit amended pavement levels, however these existing pits were not trafficable standard pits.\r\r2) Lower Electrical Conduit: There was an electrical conduit running through the far right hand side of the FESA Access road. Whilst exposed it was calculated that with the revised levels it would have only had about 250mm cover. This conduit was lowered in line with Australian Standard requirements.\r\r3) Survey: Due to revised drawings (revisions 2 and 3), we were required to undertake surveys of the road to establish revised levels and road boundaries. \r\r4) Relocate Stormwater: Due to revised drawing C0.01 (Rev 3) it was required to relocate the stormwater drains. These had previously been installed, however due to revised drawing we were required to relocate into ammended location.\r\r5) Increase levels: Due to revised drawing C0.01 Rev 3, levels of road were increased by 200-300mm and additional batter was required.\r\r6) Remedial work to road: When the gardener switched on the reticulation at the back of the school, water was discovered bubbling out from the side of the FESA Access Road. This cause the kerbing to crack and created a bubble in the road. Upon further investigation it was discovered that the water was coming from underneath the road, thus undermining the roads subbase. On 14th June 2013, we received direction to to proceed with rectification works to the road as per instruction from the Civil Engineer. Rectification Scope of Works includes:\r- Saw cut pavement (An area of 6m x 3m was required to be removed);\r- Removed affected area;\r- Locate and fix damaged pipe;\r- Replace sub-base, asphalt and kerbing in full.\r\r\rRegards,\r\rMatt Blackmore","eot_costs":0,"eot_days":""},{"uid_bvar":"EE515D70C104442CBBEBE647DEF0CF4A","uid_project":"8E6F858E0B4F48B18764A2A9ED03D8D7","details":"Fall protection to maintenance walkways","variationStatus":3,"variationStatusString":"App","isVariationInClaim":false,"variationClaimAmount":0,"variationClaimPercent":0,"variationNumber":17,"variationAmount":3003,"marginAmount":0,"raisedBy":"","uid_raisedBy":"","timestamp_created":0,"timestamp_modified":0,"externalReference":"","dateRaised":"2013-05-09T14:00:00Z","dateSubmitted":"2013-09-09T14:00:00Z","variationBalance":0,"adjustId":64652,"statusIsEstimated":false,"statusIsSubmitted":false,"statusIsApproved":false,"extensionOfTime":"","notes":"","eot_costs":0,"eot_days":""},{"uid_bvar":"CBE9D663B8414503BDAB8C1E5981226B","uid_project":"CB14211A6FE24C028B25EE5BF1BE4D53","details":"Removal of Toy Store from Contract (Withdrawn)","variationStatus":1,"variationStatusString":"Est","isVariationInClaim":false,"variationClaimAmount":0,"variationClaimPercent":0,"variationNumber":10,"variationAmount":0,"marginAmount":0,"raisedBy":"","uid_raisedBy":"","timestamp_created":0,"timestamp_modified":0,"externalReference":"","dateRaised":"2013-05-10T14:00:00Z","dateSubmitted":"2013-05-16T14:00:00Z","variationBalance":0,"adjustId":64671,"statusIsEstimated":false,"statusIsSubmitted":false,"statusIsApproved":false,"extensionOfTime":"","notes":"","eot_costs":0,"eot_days":""},{"uid_bvar":"8D343F7D22624469B6084722E9E87362","uid_project":"4BF3DC2422744B368F030E1A765BD572","details":"Lift Foyer Emergency Light & 24hrs Light","variationStatus":3,"variationStatusString":"App","isVariationInClaim":false,"variationClaimAmount":0,"variationClaimPercent":0,"variationNumber":24,"variationAmount":754.43,"marginAmount":0,"raisedBy":"","uid_raisedBy":"","timestamp_created":0,"timestamp_modified":0,"externalReference":"BV Email 07/05 RFI91","dateRaised":"2013-05-12T14:00:00Z","dateSubmitted":"2013-05-13T14:00:00Z","variationBalance":0,"adjustId":64672,"statusIsEstimated":false,"statusIsSubmitted":false,"statusIsApproved":false,"extensionOfTime":"","notes":"Pursuant to clause 52 of the contract we here by submit this variation for level 1 Lift Foyer emergency light & 24hrs lighting to each foyer.\r\rScope of Works\r\rAs per Blue Vision response to RFI No. 91 dated 05 May 2013 and direction to provide a quotation for supply and install an emergency light to level 1 and convert one of the existing lights in each foyer area to 24hr light.\r\rNo allowance has been made for any out of sequence work or reworks as a result of the above.

Neylor was given an order for the blinds and curtains only for $6580 + GST. The glazing of DW 4, 6 and 8 as per drawing A8.01 Rev 2 was issued to Jason Windows in their Windows Package. DW10 was shown to be not glazed in drawing A8.01 Rev 2. SI #126 revised the glazing scope to include DW10. The cost of DW10 to be glazed by Jason Windows was $543 + GST.\rInstead of issuing the client a cost of $10,185, Esslemont Cockram actually saved the client $3062.
